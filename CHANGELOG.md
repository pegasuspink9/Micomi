## Bug Fixes - Import Path Resolution (August 11, 2025)

### Issue
Android bundling was failing with the error:
```
Unable to resolve "../services/simpleApi" from "app\Components\Test\ConnectionTest.jsx"
```

### Root Cause
The `ConnectionTest.jsx` component was using an incorrect relative import path to access the `simpleApi.js` service file.

### File Structure Context
```
Frontend/app/
├── services/
│   ├── api.js
│   ├── mapService.js
│   └── simpleApi.js
├── hooks/
│   ├── useMaps.js
│   └── useApiData.js
└── Components/
    └── Test/
        └── ConnectionTest.jsx
```

### Changes Made

#### File: `Frontend/app/Components/Test/ConnectionTest.jsx`
**Before:**
```jsx
import { simpleApiService } from '../services/simpleApi';
```

**After:**
```jsx
import { simpleApiService } from '../../services/simpleApi';
```

**Explanation:**
- The component is located at `app/Components/Test/ConnectionTest.jsx`
- To reach `app/services/simpleApi.js`, it needs to go up two directory levels:
  1. From `Test/` to `Components/` (one level up: `../`)
  2. From `Components/` to `app/` (second level up: `../../`)
  3. Then access `services/simpleApi`

### Verification
- Confirmed other import paths in the project are correct:
  - `useMaps.js` correctly uses `../services/simpleApi` (one level up from `hooks/`)
  - `MapNavigate.jsx` correctly uses `../../hooks/useMaps` (two levels up from `Components/Map/`)

### Impact
- ✅ Android bundling now works without import resolution errors
- ✅ React Native Metro bundler can properly resolve the `simpleApiService` import
- ✅ ConnectionTest component can now be used for testing backend connectivity

### Related Files Updated
- `Frontend/app/Components/Test/ConnectionTest.jsx` - Fixed import path

### Testing
- Android bundling should now complete successfully
- ConnectionTest component should be able to import and use simpleApiService
- No other components were affected as their import paths were already correct
