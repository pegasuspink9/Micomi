Make me a lesson same as MDN flow with the syntax like this

--HTML Structure Basics:--

Every webpage has a skeleton made of tags that work together:

• DOCTYPE - This tells the browser 'Hey, I'm an HTML page!' It's always at the very top.
   Example: <!DOCTYPE html>
• <html> tag - This is the container for your *ENTIRE* page. Everything else goes inside it.
   Example:
   <html>
     ...
   </html>

next page

• <head> tag - Holds info about the page like <title>. People don't see head content on the page.
   Example:
   <head>
     <title>Site Name</title>
   </head>

next page

• <body> tag - The visible part of the page. Headings usually go here.
   Example:
   <body>
     <h2>Welcome!</h2>
   </body>

Output 

Remember: Tags open and close like parentheses. If you open <h1>, you must close it with </h1>!

Now look at the blanks - which tag belongs where?


NOTE: 

Every topic of the lesson must cover with the regex text -- -- example: --HTML Structure Basics:--

and the content of that topic must have in a bullet form to be more readable or any form will do just make it clear and has an example code of that topic like this

• DOCTYPE - This tells the browser 'Hey, I'm an HTML page!' It's always at the very top.
   Example: <!DOCTYPE html>
• <html> tag - This is the container for your *ENTIRE* page. Everything else goes inside it.
   
Example:
   <html>
     ...
   </html>

End of example

Try it yourself
Run

Output 

the code must be in code form too, and add a Try it yourself Run and Output not in the same line word as a indentifier for regex, and put a End of example after the example code


also make sure that there is a pagination so there must be a word "next page"

also add a special characters like * * in a text for bolding

this is the example of the complete lessons:

--The Origin of HTML:--

• Did you know HTML was invented by a scientist named *Tim Berners-Lee* in 1989?
• He wanted a simple way for scientists to share documents with each other all over the world.
• HTML stands for *HyperText Markup Language*. It is the secret code that builds the skeleton of *EVERY* website you visit!

Example:
<p>Hello World! I am learning the language of the web!</p>

End of example

--HTML Basic 1: Tags and Elements:--

• HTML uses special words called *tags* wrapped in angle brackets, like `<tag>`.
• Most tags have an *opening* tag and a *closing* tag (which has a slash `/`).
• Think of tags like a sandwich! The opening and closing tags are the bread, and your content is the yummy filling inside.

Example:
<p>This is my sandwich content!</p>

End of example

Remember: If you open a tag, you *MUST* close it!

--HTML Basic Tags: Headings and Paragraphs:--

• *Heading Tags* act like titles in a book. There are 6 sizes, from `<h1>` down to `<h6>`.
• `<h1>` is the biggest and most important, while `<h6>` is the smallest heading.
• The *Paragraph Tag* `<p>` is used for regular everyday text. Every new sentence or idea goes in a new `<p>` tag!

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Heading Example</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>This is heading 1 (Very Big!)</h1>
   <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
   <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
   <p>Here is a first paragraph of text.</p>
   <p>Here is a second paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>

End of example

--HTML Basic Tags: Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules:--

• Sometimes you want text to go to the next line *without* starting a whole new paragraph. Use the *Line Break Tag* `<br>`!
• Want to draw a cool straight line across the screen to separate your ideas? Use the *Horizontal Rule Tag* `<hr>`.
• *Secret Fact:* `<br>` and `<hr>` are "empty tags." That means they stand alone and do not need a closing tag!

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Breaks and Lines</title>
</head>
<body>
   <p>Hello!<br>You finished your homework on time.<br>Great job!</p>
   <hr>
   <p>This paragraph is sitting at the bottom of the line.</p>
</body>
</html>

--HTML Basic Tags: Centering and Preserve Formatting:--

• In the old days, people used a `<center>` tag, but now we use modern *CSS styling* to center text perfectly!
• Browsers usually ignore extra spaces or "enters". If you want to make text look *exactly* how you typed it (with all your custom spacing), use the *Preserve Formatting Tag* `<pre>`.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Center and Pre</title>
   <style>
      .center-text {
         text-align: center;
      }
   </style>
</head>
<body>
   <p class="center-text">Look at me, I am right in the center!</p>
   <pre>
      function testFunction( strText ){
         alert (strText)
      }
   </pre>
</body>
</html>

End of example

--HTML Basic Tags: Spaces and Lists:--

• If you want to force the browser to show extra blank spaces between words, you can use the special *Non-breaking Space* code: `&nbsp;`.
• To make a bulleted list, use the *Unordered List Tag* `<ul>`.
• To make a numbered list (1, 2, 3...), use the *Ordered List Tag* `<ol>`.
• Every single item inside your lists must be wrapped in a *List Item Tag* `<li>`!

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Spaces and Lists</title>
</head>
<body>
   <p>Look at all these spaces "12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angry Men."</p>

   <h2>My Unordered List (Bullets)</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Apples</li>
     <li>Bananas</li>
     <li>Oranges</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>My Ordered List (Numbers)</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>First Place</li>
     <li>Second Place</li>
     <li>Third Place</li>
   </ol>  
</body>
</html>

Make it a understandable lesson that kids could learn after navigating or learning it, and the inspired of the flow topics should be like from MDN


the lessons we making would be basic origin of HTML, HTML basic 1 and HTML Basic Tags:
